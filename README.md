# Thanks to George Tsatiris for teaching us the C programming language, it was a pleasure to have you as a teacher!

# /!\ **THE GAME IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT** /!\\ <br><br>

## What is this game dealing with?
MazAdventure is a little game in C that I made during my C classes at ALGOSUP. <br><br>
It's a basic game where you have to move throughout a maze to find the exit. <br>
You can move one room by room, encounter monsters and find traps. 
<br>
<br>You'll execute actions with numbers and the Enter key. <br>
The choices will be displayed to know when to use certain keys.
<br>
## How can I play?<br>
You just have to download and run the " MazAdventure.exe " to run the game. <br>
The file may be considered as harmful. No worries, you can execute it at ease. <br>
The actual version of the game is directly visible in the directory. (**Do not mind the .exe in the resources folder if you see one.**) <br>
Since the game development has not ended, the actual version of the game can contain several bugs (known or unknown).
<br>
## Can I modify the game?<br>
Since nobody can publish anything in this repository but me, you can modify your version of the game, it's up to you. <br><br>
I would even be grateful to see what changes you would implement.
