## What is this game dealing with?
MazAdventure is a little game in C that I made during my C classes at ALGOSUP. <br><br>
It's a basic game where you have to move throughout a maze to find the exit. <br>
You can move one room by room, encounter monsters and find traps. 

<br>You'll execute actions with numbers and the Enter key. <br>
The choices will be displayed to know when to use certain keys.
<br>
## How can I play?
You just have to download and run the " MazAdventure.exe " to run the game.
<br>
## Can I modify the game?
Since nobody can publish anything in this repository but me, you can modify your version of the game, it's up to you. <br><br>
I would even be grateful to see what changes you would implement.
