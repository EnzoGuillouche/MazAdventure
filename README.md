# Thanks to George Tsatiris for teaching us the C programming language, it was a pleasure to have you as a teacher!

# /!\ **THE GAME IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT** /!\\ <br><br>

## What is this game dealing with?
MazAdventure is a little game in C that I made during my C classes at ALGOSUP. <br><br>
It's a basic game where you have to move throughout a maze to find the exit. <br>
You can move one room by room, encounter monsters and find traps. 
<br>
<br>You'll execute actions with numbers and the Enter key. <br>
The choices will be displayed to know when to use certain keys.
<br>
## How can I play?<br>
**I WORKED ON WINDOWS, AND MADE AN EXECUTABLE FOR WINDOWS MACHINES.** <br><br>
First, you have to download the 'MazAdventure.exe'. You can also download the other files as dependencies [here](https://github.com/EnzoGuillouche/MazAdventure/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), it's not mandatory though.<br>
You have 2 ways to run the game:
- If you downloaded the dependencies, open the directory where you downloaded them in Visual Studio Code. Put your console as a tab. Compile 'MazAdventure.c' by typing "gcc MazAdventure.c -o MazAdventure" (you'll need to [download the compiler GCC](https://winlibs.com/), and here's a [tutorial to setup it on your machine](https://youtu.be/k6juv3mIr9o?si=Uu_ALrFlPUsk5Ogn)). Then, run 'MazAdventure.exe' from your console by typing "MazAdventure.exe", and play. 
- Run the 'MazAdventure.exe' file. This file may be considered as harmful when you run it. No worries, you can execute it at ease. Although, for some reasons, the game may have scale issues with the executable. <br>
The safest way to run the game is the 1st one. You're sure to play with no visual issue.
<br><br>
The newest version of the game is directly visible in the main branch of the repository. <br>
Since the game development has not ended, the actual version of the game can contain several bugs (known or unknown). You can open Issues on the repository (with clear descriptions).
<br><br>
## Can I modify the game?<br>
Since nobody can publish anything in this repository but me, you can modify your version of the game, it's up to you. <br><br>
I would even be grateful to see what changes you would implement.<br>
